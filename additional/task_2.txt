The following Dockerfile has been prepared for the application from the test task

# Optimize this variant

FROM ubuntu:18.04
COPY ./src /app
RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install -y nodejs
RUN npm install < --- don't ever do it
ENTRYPOINT ["npm"]
CMD ["run", "prod"]

# A better option is:

FROM node:16-alpine AS base
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install -g npm@7

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
CMD ["run", "prod"]
